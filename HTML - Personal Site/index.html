  <p>Iâ€™m a Software Analyst at Deutsche Bank. I am primarily responsible for handling automation
    projects which deal with reducing human efforts in the banking sector. I developed myself in
    many areas such as following strict Agile principles ( from planning to delivery of the code),
    following daily scrum activities and getting involved in client meetings. I learned to deliver
    code that is Modular, Consistent, Incremental and error-free.</p>
